This is my crypto currency web application 

The web application is desgined to get started with web development

Some of the main concepts and workflow I am covering + attempting to still cover include

1) user authentication (in progress)
2) api calls to external 3rd parties (3 - which are done)
3) rendering a page that renders crypto currency news for the day
4) give users the option to view the top performing coins for the day
5) or give user the option to search their favorite coins
6) I will later add an option to add coins to a users favorite list which they will have access to if they decide to create an account on my site
